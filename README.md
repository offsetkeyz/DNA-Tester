# DNA-Tester

## Description
Inspired by the CodeCademy project at the end of the section on String functions.

This program takes in a String of letters that represents a strand of DNA. The program determines if this string is DNA based on if it contains only the letters A, C, G, or T. Then it determines if the String contains a protein. It tests three predetermined Strings and prints the results. Then, it asks the user if they would like to test another string. If so, they can enter their String and the test will only run if the String is DNA. If it is, it will print out the results of the test.
